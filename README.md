#Online/Offline Budget Trackers
This application implements a service worker with a cached db. It will take in expenses either money spent or gained and keep track for budget planning. 
The user will be able to add to this budget tracker either online or offline with the implementation of the service worker functionality to store cached data offline. Once the user returns online anything saved and updated offline will reflect properly. Also has a line graph to show the flow of finances in and out
